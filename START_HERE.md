# Start Here

## What this project is
SelfLink is an open-source backend built with Django and DRF, paired with a React Native / Expo mobile app. It experiments with transparent contributor rewards enforced by code rather than promises. This repository contains the backend services and APIs.

## What already works
- Backend runs on a real domain
- Mobile app connects successfully
- Auth and core flows work
- Contributor reward ledger exists

## What this project is NOT
- Not a DAO
- Not crypto
- Not a finished product
- Not hype-driven

## Mental model
Merged contributions become immutable events → events are aggregated monthly → rewards are calculated deterministically. Everything else is an implementation detail around that loop.

## How to start contributing
- Backend contributors: see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Mobile contributors: https://github.com/georgetoloraia/selflink-mobile
- Non-coders: open issues with feedback or questions.

## First-time contributor checklist
- Fork the repo
- Run the project locally (see `README_for_env.md` or `docker_guide.md`)
- Pick a good first issue
- Ask questions openly

## Where to ask questions
- GitHub Issues
- GitHub Discussions (if enabled)
- It is always okay to ask “basic” questions in issue comments.
