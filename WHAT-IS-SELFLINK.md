# What Is SelfLink?

SelfLink is an open-source social platform (backend + mobile app) that intentionally combines multiple social products into **one transparent, inspectable system**.

Instead of building:

- a social network,
- a creator platform,
- a dating or compatibility app,
- an astrology or matrix app,
- an AI coaching product,
- and a contributor reward system

as separate, closed, opaque products,

**SelfLink explores whether all of these can exist together inside a single, open social ecosystem — where users can see how things work and participate in shaping them.**

---

## A Concrete Starting Point

Imagine a platform where:

- people post content and communicate (like Facebook / Instagram / Messenger),
- users discover each other through interests and compatibility (like Tinder),
- astrology and matrix systems calculate personal and relational insights,
- an AI Mentor gives daily, personalized guidance,
- contributors help build and maintain the platform itself,
- and users can inspect how rewards, discovery, and rules actually work.

Most platforms solve **one** of these problems in isolation.

**SelfLink intentionally combines them**, because in real life:
- social interaction,
- compatibility,
- personal growth,
- value exchange,
- and trust

are not separate experiences.

## What SelfLink Contains

### 1. Open & Transparent Social Network (Core)

SelfLink is a full social platform — not a library and not just infrastructure:

- user profiles and identity
- posts, feeds, and interactions
- messaging and connections
- discovery and visibility logic

Unlike traditional social networks, SelfLink is designed to be **open and inspectable**:
- no hidden recommendation logic
- no unexplained ranking
- no “trust the algorithm” black boxes

Users can see *why* they see what they see.

---

### 2. Compatibility & Discovery (People You Actually Want to Meet)

SelfLink includes rule-based discovery and matching inspired by:

- dating platforms
- interest-based networks
- compatibility systems

Matching is:
- explainable
- deterministic
- based on visible inputs
- not optimized for addiction or endless swiping

Users can understand **why** someone appears compatible, and decide for themselves.

---

### 3. Astrology & Matrix Systems (Structured Personal Models)

Astrology and matrix systems are **not included as belief systems**, but as **structured identity engines**.

They provide:
- deterministic inputs (birth data)
- reproducible outputs
- long-term personal models
- compatibility logic that can be inspected

These systems are:
- computed deterministically
- stored as structured data
- reusable by AI and discovery logic

They power:
- personal insights
- relationship compatibility
- timing-based guidance

Users may opt into or out of these systems — SelfLink still works without them.

---

### 4. AI Mentor (Personal Growth & Daily Guidance)

SelfLink includes an **AI Mentor** that goes beyond generic chatbots.

The AI Mentor:
- understands the user’s personal context
- uses social data, history, and optional astrology/matrix inputs
- gives **situational, time-aware advice**

Examples:
- “Today is not a good day to sign contracts.”
- “Negotiations are favored today.”
- “This period is emotionally unstable — avoid escalating conflicts.”

The goal is **contextual intelligence**, not generic motivation.

---

### 5. Contributor Rewards & Built-In Value Layer

SelfLink includes a transparent contributor reward system:

- contributions (code, moderation, content, governance) are recorded as events
- rewards are calculated deterministically
- monthly snapshots are reproducible and auditable
- no hidden payouts, no discretionary decisions

This applies not only to developers, but eventually to:
- moderators
- creators
- system contributors

Contributors are closer to **participants in a system**, not disposable labor.

---

### 6. Transparency & Participation (The Inner Kitchen Is Visible)

Users are not passive consumers.

They can:
- inspect how recommendations and compatibility work
- understand how rewards and incentives are structured
- participate in discussions about system rules and evolution

The goal is not “voting on everything”, but **informed participation**.

---

## What Problem Does SelfLink Solve?

Most platforms today are:

- fragmented (many apps for one human experience)
- opaque (users don’t know how decisions are made)
- trust-based (contributors rely on promises)
- closed (you can’t inspect or extend them)

SelfLink explores a different model:

> **A unified social platform where social interaction, compatibility, personal growth, AI guidance, and rewards are enforced by readable, auditable code.**

---

## What Can You Do With SelfLink?

You might reach for SelfLink if you’re thinking:

- “I want a social platform that isn’t controlled by hidden algorithms.”
- “I want to meet people I’m actually compatible with.”
- “I want daily guidance that understands who I am and where I’m going.”
- “I want contributors to earn value transparently.”
- “I want users to trust the system, not the founder.”

SelfLink is **one social ecosystem**, not a collection of disconnected tools.

## One-Sentence Summary

> **SelfLink is an open, transparent social ecosystem that combines social networking, compatibility, astrology-based personal models, AI mentorship, and contributor rewards into a single, auditable system.**

---

## Important Note

**SelfLink is intentionally ambitious.**

Not all parts are finished, and not all ideas are proven.

This repository is a living experiment in building social software that:
- unifies human interaction instead of fragmenting it
- replaces opaque algorithms with visible rules
- and scales trust, not just features
