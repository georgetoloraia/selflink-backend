SelfLink is an open-source backend and mobile app that combines multiple social products into one transparent platform.

Instead of building:

- a social network,
- a creator platform,
- a compatibility app,
- an astrology app,
- and a contributor reward system
as separate, closed products,

SelfLink explores whether all of these can exist together on top of a single, transparent, code-enforced system.

### A Concrete Starting Point

Imagine a platform where:
- creators post content (like Instagram or TikTok),
- users discover each other through compatibility and interests (like Tinder),
- astrology and matrix systems calculate personal and relational insights,
- contributors build and maintain the system itself,
- and everyone can verify how rewards, rankings, and rules work.

Most platforms solve one of these problems in isolation.
SelfLink intentionally combines them.

### What SelfLink Contains

1. Contributor Rewards (Core Infrastructure)

SelfLink includes a transparent contributor reward system:
- contributions (code, moderation, content, governance) are recorded as events
- rewards are calculated deterministically
- monthly snapshots can be reproduced and audited by anyone
- no hidden payouts, no discretionary decisions

This makes contributors closer to co-founders, based on measurable impact rather than promises.

2. A Social Network (Not Just Posts)

SelfLink is a full social platform, not a library:
- user profiles and identity
- posts, feeds, interactions
- messaging and connections
- discovery and visibility logic

But unlike traditional social networks, these features exist to support meaningful interaction and transparency, not engagement tricks.

3. Compatibility & Discovery

SelfLink includes rule-based discovery and matching, inspired by:
- dating apps (e.g. Tinder)
- compatibility platforms
- interest-based networks

Matching is:
- explainable
- deterministic
- not a black-box algorithm

Users can understand why they are compatible or shown to each other.

4. Astrology & Matrix Systems

SelfLink integrates:
- astrological calculations
- matrix-based personality systems
- compatibility logic based on these models

These systems are:
- computed deterministically
- reproducible
- stored as structured data

They power both personal insights and user-to-user compatibility.

5. Transparency for Users

Users are not passive consumers.

They can:
- see how recommendations and compatibility work
- understand how rewards and incentives are structured
- express opinions on system rules and changes

The goal is not “voting on everything”, but informed participation.

### What Problem Does This Solve?

Most platforms today are:
- fragmented (many apps for one experience)
- opaque (users don’t know how things work)
- trust-based (contributors rely on promises)
- closed (you can’t inspect or extend them)

SelfLink explores a different model:

> A unified social platform where content, compatibility, rewards, and governance are > all enforced by readable, auditable code.

### What Can You Do With SelfLink?

You might reach for SelfLink if you’re thinking:
- “I want to build a social platform with creators and contributors.”
- “I want compatibility and discovery without black-box algorithms.”
- “I want astrology or matrix logic integrated into a real app.”
- “I want contributors to earn ownership transparently.”
- “I want users to trust the system, not the founder.”

SelfLink is a platform, not a single feature.
